SCRIPT DESCRIPTION

This script is design to receive the output data from ‘Cell_Selection.cppipe’, extract the relevant data and present it in a user-friendly format with data sorted and exported into a single Excel document.




SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD

This script was written in the Python v3.10.9 using Thonny IDE v4.0.2. Make sure Python is downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads. Any Python IDE can be used to access the script. Thonny is a free open source Python IDE that can be downloaded at https://thonny.org. 





SCRIPT SETTINGS

Open script with your Python IDE (Thonny). The very first two lines of the program will read:

1) input_path = "/Users/Desktop/Automated_Histone_Modification/Data/Excel_Files/CSV/Data/"

2) output_path = "/Users/Desktop/Automated_Histone_Modification/Data/Excel_Files/XLSX/Processed/"

Copy the path of the output data folder from the previous script (Cell_Selection.cppipe). Paste this path to replace the path on the first line. 

Locate your desired output data folder, or create your own. Copy the pathname and paste this path to replace the path on the second line.




RUN SCRIPT

Open script with your Python IDE (Thonny). Double check the input and output file paths are the desired paths.
